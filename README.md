# Finite Element Method

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to complex engineering problems involving structural, thermal, and fluid dynamics by breaking down a large system into smaller, simpler parts called elements. It provides a way to simulate and analyze physical behaviors, such as stress, deformation, and heat transfer, with high accuracy and efficiency.
